# :clap: CLAP :clap:
CLoud Application Platform provides a interface to manage, interact and deploy HPC applications hosted in different cloud provieders.
CLAP is based in the [elasticluster](https://github.com/elasticluster/elasticluster) project, a tool that allows automated setup of compute clusters
(MPI, Spark/Hadoop, etc) and their management. CLAP extend the project by allowing a simplified interface to interact with the compute nodes.
Some of the features are:
* YAML-Style configuration files to define nodes, logins and cloud configurations
* User-friendly interface to create, setup, manage, interact and stop multiple computing nodes on different cloud providers at the same time
* Group system to easily perform actions in different heterogeneous nodes via [Ansible](https://ansible.com/) playbooks
* Easy-to-use python API
